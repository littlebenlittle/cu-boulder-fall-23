## Formalize Basic Complexity Results in Agda

I will look into existing complexity libraries for Coq, Agda, and other proof assistants. I will compare different models like *boolean*-valued predicates vs *type*-valued predicates. I will attempt to demonstrate some proofs we did in the problem sets, like showing that $\textbf{C} \subseteq \text{co}\textbf{C} \implies \textbf{C} = \text{co}\textbf{C}$ and the Time Hierarchy Theorem.

Some starting points for this research are

G채her and Kunze prove the Cook-Levin theorem (all NP problems are p-time reducible to SAT) using a series of verified steps to compile decision problems written in L into SAT instances. They define the generic NP problem for L GenNP that asks, "given an L program $s$, a size $k$ for the witness, and number of steps $t$, does there exist an input of size no greater than $k$ for which $s$ halts in no more than $t$ steps?" They show that GenNP is NP-hard, i.e. for every L program in NP there exists a poly-time reduction to GenNP. They then prove there exists a poly-time reduction to the generic problem for Turing Machines TMGenNP, and then eventually that TMGenNP poly-time reduces to SAT.
